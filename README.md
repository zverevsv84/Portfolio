# Project_Yandex.Music
Comparison of Moscow and St. Petersburg is surrounded by myths. For example:
 * Moscow is a metropolis subject to the rigid rhythm of the working week;
 * St. Petersburg is a cultural capital, with its own tastes.

Using Yandex.Music data, you will compare the behavior of users in the two capitals.

**Research Purpose** - Test three hypotheses:
1. User activity depends on the day of the week. Moreover, in Moscow and St. Petersburg this manifests itself in different ways.
2. On Monday morning, certain genres prevail in Moscow, while others prevail in St. Petersburg. Similarly, Friday evenings are dominated by different genres, depending on the city.
3. Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different genres of music. In Moscow, they listen to pop music more often, in St. Petersburg - Russian rap.

**Research Progress**

You will receive data on user behavior from the `yandex_music_project.csv` file. Nothing is known about the quality of the data. Therefore, before testing hypotheses, a review of the data is required.

You will check the data for errors and assess their impact on the study. Then, during the pre-processing phase, you will look for opportunities to correct the most critical data errors.
 
Thus, the study will take place in three stages:
 1. Data review.
 2. Data preprocessing.
 3. Hypothesis testing.
